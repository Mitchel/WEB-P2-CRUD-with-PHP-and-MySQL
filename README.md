# web-p2
For my school education Software Development we have an assignment with CRUD, PHP & MySQL for period 2 of Webdevelopment. The goal for this period is to learn to work with the server-side scripting language PHP and the database MySQL for storing, reading, changing and deleting data from a database. These operations are often summarized in the word CRUD.
